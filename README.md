Ultrasonic Room Mapping

Using an Arduino Nano, servo motor and ultrasonic to collect the pints and the angle and storing it in an excel sheet.
This data is then used to plot a the points and an outline of the walls in python.

The first part requires you to install ROS on your machine and install the necessary packages along with Arduino IDE.
Note that this repository only contains the Python Code for the second part.
P.s. the second part is done theoritically so you can find an excel sheet containing ideal values for a Square Room
